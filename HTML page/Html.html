On the left side there are four blue cups, in one of them is a red ball. Hover your mose over the cup you guess the ball is in. The animation that the cup uses is just one impresive example of how css can be integrated ingto websites in a unique way! </div>

	<p> <a href="http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/examples/css3d_periodictable.html"> This impresive link show you what you can acomplish with html css and javascript! </a>  Although it is extremmly difficult to code something like that using Css javascript and Html, it is possible. The two most important resources to build a website are html and css. Altough both of these programs help you, they do so in different ways.
	<br />
	<h3> Html </h3>
	<br /> Html acts as the main setup for your website. it is responsible for text, images, links, and  a-lot more.
	Html stands for Hypertext-Markup Language. Html is basically just a standard and conveniant system for tagging. A tag is a command that changes the layout of a webpage, for example if I wanted to create a line break I would type br / inside of two pound signs. Html formating is important because it is the main makeup of a webpage. Without the html, nothing would be functional.
	<br />
	<h3>CSS</h3>
	<br/> CSS is another crucial part into making a webpage. without CSS without it, a webpage would look bare and boring, even colorless. CSS literally means cascading style sheets, in other words, CSS is what makes the webpage look good. CSS is written on a different document than html, a link to it has to be written on the html that looks like link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"  href="Html.css"  written inside pound signs. Together Html and css make a pretty good loking webpage.
