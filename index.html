        <div id="five"> <h3>Intro</h3> Hello! Welcome to my
	
     website! Glad to see you stopped by.
    	The main purpouse of this website is to explain the main compenents of coding and software. I hope to explain the following information to the best of my ability:
    	<ul:>
    	<li> Computer Hardware
    	<li> HTML basics
    	<li> My experiences with coding (About me)
    	</ul>
    	</li>
    	</p>
    In this course, I hope to cover all I have learned in my computer science course, I also hope to post the projects that I have worked on on this website. Each link of mine in the navbar explains different components I have learned. 
        The computer hardware page elaborates on the components of computers and how they function, the HTML basics describes the main components of creating a website and the about me page tells you more information about myself.
        In addition to that there are four links in the navbar that link to my projects, the calculator link is too a calculator I created with javacript, the RPG story to a link with an interactive story game I created in a group, the zombie game to a shooter game that utilizes Javascript, and the vindinium to 
        a page that describes AI and how it is used in the game Vindinium. 
    <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2> So what's the Point?</h2>
        
       The main point of my website is to demonstrate my learning! It is also a place to orginize all of the projects I have completed. 
        Overall, this page acts as a hub for all of my other webpages, so click one of the links to see the other work I have done!
